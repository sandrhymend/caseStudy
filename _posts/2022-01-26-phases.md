## 1. Ask
Sršen asks you to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. She then wants you to select one Bellabeat product to apply these insights to in your presentation. These questions will guide your analysis:

1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

**Business task**:
Identify through our analysis the trends in smart device usage and how can apply this results to Bellabeat's customers for grow.

## 2. Prepare
Sršen encourages you to use public data that explores smart device users’ daily habits. She points you to a specific data set:
* [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data][1]{:target="_blank"} (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through [Mobius][2]{:target="_blank"}): This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.

Sršen tells you that this data set might have some limitations, and encourages you to consider adding another data to help address those limitations as you begin to work more with this data.

Dataset include 18 files, but some of them are more detail of one of the files, After review the data, I conclude the main files are:

| # | Main Files | Description
| :---  | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | dailyActivity_merged.csv | 33 users found |
| 2 | sleepDay_merged.csv | 24 users found after removed 3 duplicated rows |
| 3 | heartrate_seconds_merged.csv | 14 users found |
| 4 | weightLogInfo_merged.csv | 8 users found |

This small size of sample data was taken from 4/12/2016 to 5/9/2016. Sorted and filtered the data of the analysis of 28 days.
[See more details][3]

**Limitations**
* The data isn't representative of all FitBit users.
* The data is old.
* Most of the users don't record all the activities.

## 3. Process
It is the process known as data cleaning, formatting and fixing or removing incorrect data. Our achieve is clean data and prepare for our analisis process. Using proper tools to prepare the data. [See our process][4]


## 4. Analyze and Share
Now that your data is stored appropriately and has been prepared for analysis, start putting it to work. Once we have completed our analysis, create our data visualizations. The visualizations should clearly communicate our high-level insights and recommendations.

## 5. Act
After analyzing this data from FitBit Fitness Tracker Data. This small size of sample data was taken from 4/12/2016 to 5/9/2016. Sorted and filtered the data of the analysis of 28 days.

We found in our analyzis that daily activity on active lifestyle is more trend in this kind of smart device.
I evaluated the participants who frecuently used their devices and It tracked most of all participants are "High Usage", It means that Leaf band or watch are the most trend device that track the steps, the intensity of their activity and how many calories they burned.

```
ggplot(participants_use, aes(fill=usage, y = participants, x = "")) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1, color = "white") +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0)+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = 'Blues') +
  theme_void() +
  theme(axis.title.x =element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank(),
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, vjust = -5, size = 20, face = "bold")) +
  geom_text(aes(label = perc, x =1.2), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Usage Daily Activity") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Usage Type"))
```

## 6. Conclusion and Recommendations
According with this article [**14 Fitness Trackers That Are Better Than Having Your Own Workout Buddy**][5]{:target="_blank"} from Forbes found the band or a smartwatch are popular because most people are looking to stay in shape and these devices remind you to exercise and work as your own personal trainer.

This analysis the trends in smart device usage and how can apply this results to Bellabeat's customers for grow.

We can conclude that our analysis found some missing data that can be improve with Bellabeat's customers. Improving the devices or marketing how can the user track their weight and sleep in order to keep a good health.
